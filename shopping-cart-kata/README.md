Write a simple program that calculates the price of a shopping basket. Items are presented one at

a time, in a list, identified by name - for example "Apple" or "Garlic". 

The basket can contain any item multiple times.

Items are priced as follows:

 - Apples are 25p each

 - Oranges are 30p each

 - Garlic are 15p each

 - Papayas are 50p each, but are available as ‘three for the price of two’

Given a list of shopping, calculate the total cost of those items. The output should be displayed

similar to what you would expect to see on a receipt.
