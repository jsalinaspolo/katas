#### Description
The Romans wrote their numbers using letters; specifically the letters "I, V, X, L, C, D, and M." There were certain rules that the numerals followed which should be observed.

The symbols 'I', 'X', 'C', and 'M' can be repeated at most 3 times in a row. 'V', 'L', and 'D' can never be repeated.

As arabic numbers can be split into their constituent parts (1066 becomes 1 0 6 6), so too can Roman numerals, just without the zero (1066 becomes MLXVI, or M (1000) LX (60) and VI (6)).

The '1' symbols ('I', 'X', and 'C') can only be subtracted from the 2 next highest values ('IV' and 'IX', 'XL' and 'XC', 'CD' and 'CM'). The '5' symbols ('V', 'L', and 'D') can never be subtracted.

Only one subtraction can be made per numeral ('XC' is allowed, 'XXC' is not).

We have provided a reference table of the Roman numerals that you will have to use and their arabic number equivalents.
